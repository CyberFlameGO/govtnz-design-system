<p>Help users by using our patterns which provide easy action flows for specific tasks, as well as templates for common forms.
Typical examples include collecting users&#39; address and contact details, and
guiding users through a step-by-step application form.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be inviting you to co-design some patterns with us soon. To keep updated
with what we are doing now, what we are planning to do next, and how you can
