        Government Information Services
    </a>&nbsp;
    is creating New Zealand’s New Zealand Government Design System (NZGDS) now. Our
    overall aim is to improve digital service delivery across the New Zealand
    public service.
</P>

Since the AOG Design System will be available for everyone in central and local
government — and beyond — to use, we want a strong cross-government community
backing it.

You can contribute by:

* testing our components and patterns
* helping to develop new components and patterns
* commenting on our guidance.

This alpha website shows you what we have built so far, what we're working on,
and how you can get involved.&nbsp;
[Read about the benefits of using the NZGDS, and how we are building it, on the homepage](https://design-system-alpha.digital.govt.nz/).

## Keep updated

The input and feedback we received from the initial user research, meetups,
workshop, and user testing has been invaluable in shaping the alpha Design
System.
