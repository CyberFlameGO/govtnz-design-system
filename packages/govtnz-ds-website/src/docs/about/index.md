# About the Design System alpha website

<P styleSize="large">
    The New Zealand Government Design System (NZGDS) alpha website provides
    a catalogue of reusable basic elements, single components, and patterns of
    components for building websites and applications, along with guidance on
    how and when to use them. 
</P>

All of Government Services Delivery is creating the NZGDS now. Our overall aim is to improve digital
service delivery across the New Zealand public service.

[Read about the benefits of using our Design System, and how we are building it, on the homepage](https://design-system-alpha.digital.govt.nz/).

This alpha website shows you what we have built so far, what we're working on,
and how you can get involved.

## Get involved

Since the Design System will be available for everyone in central and local
government (and beyond) to use, we want a strong cross-government community
backing it. You can contribute by:

- testing our components and patterns
- helping to develop new components and patterns
- commenting on our guidance.
