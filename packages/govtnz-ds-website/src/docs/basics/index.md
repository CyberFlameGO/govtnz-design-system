# Basics

Basic design elements apply to all parts of a website. Key basic elements provided by the all-of-government (AOG) design system alpha include typography and colour guidance for interaction design. Additional basic elements are coming soon.

Browse available basics via the sidebar menu if you’re on a desktop, or the main menu if you’re using a mobile.
